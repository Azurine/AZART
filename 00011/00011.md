## AZART 00011

I made a mistake early on, and I realized that the first 10 AZART collectibles have names that are off by 1 from the token contract's token numbers. So, I'm retiring the name "AZART 00011" without associating it with an AZART / Azurine Art token. This will allow "AZART 00012" to refer to the 12th token generated by the AZART contract.

Blockchains are forever! :)
