## AZART 00011

I made a mistake early on, and I realized that the first 10 AZART collectibles have names that are off by 1 from the token contract's token numbers. When I noticed a mistake on my first token, I burned it (when I should have just pulled it from sale). So, I'm retiring the name "AZART 00011" without associating it with an AZART / Azurine Art token. This will allow "AZART 00012" to refer to the 12th token generated by the AZART contract.

Blockchains are forever! :)

"AZART 00011" can refer to the burned first token: https://app.rarible.com/token/0xe28d2d4f778a2061ac2ae1080c76c4bd0a6f2d3a:1 but realistically, there is no token with "AZART 00011" in the name.
