## Name:

Georgy Voronoy (AZART 00088)

## Description: 

Georgy Voronoy (1868 - 1908) was a Russian mathematician who defined the Voronoi diagram, a way to partition space into regions. Given a set of points, areas closer to one point than any other are collected into a region called a cell. The boundaries of cells describe locations that are equidistant between two or more points. 

This animated portrait is made of 30 Voronoi diagrams, each with a different quantity of defined points. Cell color is defined by that cell's point's color. 

Artist's note: a few artistic liberties were taken due to the low-quality, public-domain source file and the imprecise nature of these tessellations in raster imagery.
