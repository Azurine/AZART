## Name:

Athena Parthenos (AZART 00096)

## Description: 

The goddess of wisdom, justice, creativity, and purity dances among glowing dust clouds, hot young stars, cold old stars, and the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Imaged in X-ray and infrared light, the galaxy center contains over a hundred thousand stars, three large star clusters, filaments of glowing dust clouds, and is permeated with gasses heated to millions of degrees.
