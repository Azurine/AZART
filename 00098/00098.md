## Name:

Leda and Cygnus (AZART 00098)

## Description: 

Leda, a princess and later a queen of Sparta, was admired by Zeus. He transformed into a swan and fell into her arms for protection from a pursuing eagle. He seduced her and among their children was Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world.

We see their legendary courting within the wisps of the supernova remnant creating the Veil Nebula. Also known as the Cygnus Loop, the Veil Nebula lies 1,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan.
