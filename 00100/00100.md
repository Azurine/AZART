## Name:

Fleece of Al Bakr (AZART 00100)

## Description: 

The earliest surviving record of the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Muslim astronomer Al-Sufi in 964. In his Book of Fixed Stars he named it Al Bakrâ€”Sheep of the Southern Arabs. He noted that it was not viewable from northern Arabia but only at the southernmost tip.

The colorful filaments of debris in N49 make up the brightest supernova remnants in Al Bakr. Also seen in this image is a portion of the Carina Nebula, which similarly is only viewable from the southern hemisphere.
