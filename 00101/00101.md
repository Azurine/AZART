## Name:

Artemis and Orion (AZART 00101)

## Description: 

Artemis—goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and childbirth—hunted alongside Orion, the most handsome of the Earth-born. Orion was killed, but thanks to Artemis’s pleas, he was raised to become a constellation.

The famous Orion Nebula is the closest center of massive star birth to Earth, visible to the naked eye as the middle ‘star’ in Orion’s sword. Artemis’s body is adorned with the ancient stars of Omega Centauri, Milky Way’s largest and brightest cluster.
