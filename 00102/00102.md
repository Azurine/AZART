## Name:

Chiron's Cool Tie (AZART 00102)

## Description: 

Most Centaurs were brutesâ€”wild, lusty, and violent delinquents. Chiron in contrast was intelligent, civilized, and held to be the superlative among the centaurs. I like to imagine him as a cool dude wearing a bow tie.

The Boomerang Nebula is located 5,000 light years away in the constellation Centaurus. When a low to medium-mass star burns all of its hydrogen fuel, it may start fusing helium. This is a very unstable process and the outer layers of the star can be ejected to eventually form a planetary nebula. This process is ongoing in the Boomerang Nebula, where its gas is ejecting from the star at 164 km/s. It is expanding so fast that this is actually the coolest place ever observed naturally, at 1 degree Kelvin.
