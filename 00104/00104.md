## Name:

Echo of the Unicorn (AZART 00104)

## Description: 

As a punishment for tricking Hera, Echo was cursed to only be able to repeat the last words shouted by others. When she accidentally drove away a man she loved, she wept her body away until only her voice remained.

A star in the constellation Monoceros inexplicably brightened in 2002. As astronomers watched and studied, they saw beautiful swirls of dust around the star that were previously unseen. This dust is actually behind the star, more distant from Earth, that the light from the star is bouncing off of before reaching Earth. This effect is a light echo.
