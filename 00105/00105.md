## Name:

Jorōgumo (AZART 00105)

## Description: 

In Japanese legend, when a common spider turns 400 years old, it acquires magical powers and becomes a Jorōgumo, a creature that can shapeshift into a deadly, beautiful woman. In Edo period stories, a Jorōgumo is sometimes said to carry its egg-sack disguised as a baby when travelling, and is said to make their nests deep in the forest, in caves, or in abandoned spaces. In this image, we see a Jorōgumo, both resting and watching, beside its greatest treasure: it's children.

The young stellar grouping R136 resides in the Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus), in the Large Megallanic Cloud orbiting the Milky Way Galaxy. It is the most active and largest starburst (star birth) region in the Local Group of galaxies.
