## Name:

Soul of the Water Bearer (AZART 00106)

## Description: 

Ganymede was born mortal but was rewarded with immortality to be the cup-bearer to the gods of Olympus. Later Ganymede was raised to the heavens to become the constellation Aquarius.

Socrates suggested in Plato’s dialogues that Zeus loved Ganymede’s beautiful psyche or soul. In this image, Ganymede is presented with Messier 72, a globular star cluster that lies 53,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius.
