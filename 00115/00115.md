## Name:

String Vibration 03

## Description: 

The String Vibration series was inspired by a theoretical framework known as string theory, where the particles of particle physics are described as one-dimensional strings, and a string's vibration defines its properties: mass, charge, etc.

This is an unmanipulated photograph of a single string in motion, lit with colored LEDs.
