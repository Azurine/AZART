# AZART

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION
### BLOCKCHAIN
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like the more well-known juggernaut, Bitcoin, that operates by recording data in a public ledger; the blockchain. Instead of primarily being used to record transactions, Ethereum allows smart contracts—programs—to be run on its blockchain.

### FUNGIBILITY
Most digital currencies or ‘coins’ are fungible; meaning that any one unit is just as good as any other unit. 1 Ether in one person’s wallet is just as valuable as 1 Ether in another person’s wallet. However, Ethereum allows for the creation of tradable units that are not fungible.

## THE ART
AZART collectible artwork is published online for the world to appreciate in digital formats at display resolution. These files are stored on the main project website, Azurine.art, as well as in a public github repository. Another version of the artwork also exists—one that allows creation of a physical version or representation of the artwork. Prints and physical versions of the artwork are only available to current and past owner-addresses, and these physical versions are made from higher resolution images. These files cannot be public but are redundantly backed up and archived. They are permanently available to the operators of the AZART project to create physical versions. A local master file, distributed local backups, and paid cloud storage solutions will ensure file redundancy.

### SALE PROFIT-SPLITTING
When creating an AZART collectible, Azurine can set a royaly amount that will pay Azurine every time the AZART collectible transacts. This choice was made to balance the interest of crypto-speculators and art patrons. Specific details are recorded in the meta descriptions of the pieces.

## LONGEVITY
It is in the best interest of the artist and his heirs to continue the project indefinitely. As Azurine creates more work, it will bring more visibility to the project and his earlier work. More popular pieces will transact more frequently, but less popular pieces will be tempting to speculators and art appreciators due to their lower prices. In either case, AZART pieces will continue to be a store of value.

## AUTHENTICITY
When Azurine creates an AZART and publishes it on the blockchain and the project websites, it contains a method for verifying the authenticity of the artwork associated with it. The AZART’s digital artwork file however, is too large to store on the Ether blockchain. The artwork’s digital file, which is stored in the website’s directories or databases and on other file servers and mirrors, must be provable authentic.

### VERIFICATION
Authenticity of AZART images are easy to test. Check the SHA-256 hash of the image file with a PC utility or online with a tool such as https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256_checksum.html or similar. The image will be authentic if the result you get is the same as the one that is embedded in the AZART collectible's metadata.

For example, AZART #00001 has the following hash embedded in its metadata: 3b9a6ab6f269cf029c66cc67ac862f6d16b1ef7aa8ec81b7ac0f13e3f9178268.
Download the image #00001 from the project website, a mirror, or from the github repository, and check its SHA-256. If it matches, you know you’re buying a verifyably original piece created by Azurine.

### DATA SECURITY
The Azurine.art website will be backed up regularly, automatically, and all art is stored redundantly. Github is also pretty secure... It is in the best interest of Azurine and their heirs to maintain the project and allow the ordering of prints or physical versions indefinitely.
